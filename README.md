# Brains Copy Paste [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wehlutyk/brainscopypaste.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wehlutyk/brainscopypaste)

Software developed to build our "Brains Copy Paste" paper, analyzing mutation in quotes when they propagate through the blog- and news-spaces (this should tell us stuff on how the brain copy-pastes and alters quotes when doing so).

The latex source (along with compiled pdf) for the paper is at [wehlutyk/brainscopypaste-paper](https://github.com/wehlutyk/brainscopypaste-paper).

TODO/OUTDATED: See the [documentation](https://brainscopypaste.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) if you want to install, run, or understand any of this.
