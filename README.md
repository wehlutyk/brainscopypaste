Analyzing mutation in quotes when they propagate through the blog- and news-spaces. This should tell us stuff on how the brain copy-pastes and alters quotes when doing so.

This software was developed for a research paper based on the [MemeTracker](http://memetracker.org/) quotes database [to be pusblished]. It is released under the GNU/GPLv3 licence.

[The documentation](https://brainscopypaste.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) explains all about how to setup and use the software.
