"""Analyze data in ways that are not specifically linguistic.

These modules use data loaded from raw dataset files by the datainterface
package, and stored in objects defined in the datastructure package. They can
plug into the objects defined in the datastructure package to provide an
object-oriented interface to the data (see the datastructure package for
details).

Modules:
  * linalg: linear algebra tools, specifically to compute the PageRank
            algorithm
  * memetracker: analyze data from the MemeTracker dataset
