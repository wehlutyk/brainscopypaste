"""Analyze data in ways that are not specifically linguistic.

These modules use data loaded from raw dataset files by the datainterface package, and stored in objects defined in the
datastructure package. They plug into the objects defined in that datastructure package to provide an object-oriented
interface to the data (see the datastructure package for details).
