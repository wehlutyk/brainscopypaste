Introduction
============

This software analyzes mutations in quotes when they propagate through the blog- and news-spaces, measuring the way the brain copy-pastes and alters quotes when we write blog posts. It was developed for a research paper based on the `MemeTracker <http://memetracker.org/>`_ quotes database [LeriqueRoth12]_. It is released under the MIT license.
