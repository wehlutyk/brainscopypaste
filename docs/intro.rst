.. _intro:

This software is a toolchain for the analysis of mutations in quotes when they propagate through the blog- and news-spaces, measuring some ways in which we alter quotes when we write blog posts.
It was developed for a research paper based on the `MemeTracker <http://memetracker.org/>`_ quotes database `[LeriqueRoth16] <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01143986/>`_, and is released under the GPLv3 license.

This documentation will walk you through the steps to install and run the complete analysis to reproduce the results of the paper, and gives you access to all the tools used during exploration of the data. Hey, these are the days of open science!

We'll be referring to several concepts defined and discussed in the paper, so it might be helpful if you read it first.
